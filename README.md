I developed and implemented efficient data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees 
using the C programming language. The project focused on optimizing operations like data insertion, 
deletion, and search, with an emphasis on time and space complexity. I worked with pointers and 
dynamic memory allocation to ensure high performance and efficient resource usage, testing a variety of functionalities.
